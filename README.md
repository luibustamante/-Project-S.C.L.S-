# -Project-S.C.L.S-
Smart Cinematic Lighting System (SCLS) is a project that explores how engineering and programming can improve lighting on small film sets. Using light and color sensors connected to an Arduino, along with a Python-based control system, SCLS measures real lighting conditions and compares them to predefined cinematic profiles.
